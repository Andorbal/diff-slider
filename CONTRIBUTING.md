## Layout

| Path | What lives there |
| --- | --- |
| `src/extension.ts` | Activation, the `historySlider.showHistory` command, working out which file (and commit) it was invoked on |
| `src/historyPanel.ts` | One webview panel per file: loads history, serves file contents, watches the file and repository |
| `src/fileHistory.ts`, `src/git.ts` | Git access (`git log --follow`, a long-lived `git cat-file --batch`). No `vscode` imports, so they are tested against real repositories |
| `src/shared/protocol.ts` | Messages between the extension and the webview |
| `webview/` | The panel UI: `slider.ts` (timeline and handles), `sliderModel.ts` (pure layout/selection logic), `diffView.ts` (Monaco diff editor), `card.ts` (commit popup), `app.ts` (wiring) |
| `test/demo/` | Records the animations in the README (`npm run demos`) |
| `esbuild.mjs` | Bundles the extension, the webview (with Monaco) and Monaco's diff worker into `dist/`, stamping the extension and webview with the same build id (`src/shared/build.ts`) so a panel notices when VS Code is still running another build |

## Build and run

```sh
npm install
npm run build        # or: npm run watch
```

Press **F5** in VS Code ("Run Extension") to start an Extension Development Host.

## Tests

```sh
npm run typecheck
npm test             # unit tests: git layer against temporary repos, slider logic, formatting
npm run test:ui      # the webview in headless Chromium with a mock extension host
npm run check        # all of the above
```

The UI tests (`test/ui`) serve the built webview the way VS Code does: the page and its assets on different origins, under the same Content-Security-Policy the extension sets. They fail on any console error or CSP violation, and they check that Monaco's diff worker really starts.

### End-to-end tests in VS Code

`test/e2e` drives the real extension inside [code-server](https://github.com/coder/code-server) (VS Code in a browser). They are skipped unless `HISTORY_SLIDER_CODE_SERVER` is set.

```sh
# code-server needs Node 24 and, on Linux, libkrb5-dev to build.
npm install --prefix /tmp/cs code-server

# Point an extensions directory at this checkout.
mkdir -p /tmp/cs-ext && ln -sfn "$PWD" /tmp/cs-ext/AndrewBenz.history-slider-0.3.0

npm run build
/tmp/cs/node_modules/.bin/code-server --auth none --bind-addr 127.0.0.1:8123 \
  --extensions-dir /tmp/cs-ext --user-data-dir /tmp/cs-data --disable-workspace-trust &

HISTORY_SLIDER_CODE_SERVER=http://127.0.0.1:8123 npm run test:e2e
```

Each run creates a throwaway repository and checks: the keybinding, dragging across a rename, saving the **Content changes only** setting, opening VS Code's diff editor, live updates while typing, refreshing after an outside `git commit`, restoring after a window reload, and the Timeline and Explorer context menus.

### Recording the README animations

The GIFs in `media/demo` are recordings of the real extension in code-server, made by `test/demo/demos.spec.ts` on the history of [Express](https://github.com/expressjs/express) (MIT License). Record them again when the UI changes:

```sh
# code-server as for the end-to-end tests, and ffmpeg with the palettegen filter
# (apt install ffmpeg, brew install ffmpeg, or set FFMPEG to its path).
CODE_SERVER=/tmp/cs/node_modules/.bin/code-server npm run demos

# Just one of them (scrub-history, follow-renames, step-through-commits, live-working-copy):
CODE_SERVER=/tmp/cs/node_modules/.bin/code-server npm run demos -- -g follow-renames
```

The first run clones Express into `.demos/express` and checks out a pinned commit, so the timelines stay the same. Each run builds the extension, starts its own code-server on a free port (a fresh profile in `.demos/vscode`, with a dark theme and this checkout as the extension), records each scene with Chromium's screencast and overwrites `media/demo/<scene>.gif`. The scenes check what they show, such as the commit counts at that commit and the rename on the commit card, so a run fails rather than recording something broken. Look at the GIFs before committing them, and keep each one to a few MB. They aren't packaged: `.vscodeignore` includes only the files directly in `media`, and `vsce` points the README's images at GitHub.

## Packaging and releases

```sh
npm run package      # history-slider-<version>.vsix
```

The **Build** workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) runs the typecheck, unit tests and UI tests on every push to `main` and every pull request, then packages the extension. The `.vsix` is attached to the run as an artifact named `history-slider-<version>-<sha>`.

To publish a release, bump the version (`npm version <x.y.z> --no-git-tag-version` updates `package.json` and `package-lock.json`), add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and once that is on `main`, push a matching tag:

```sh
git tag v0.3.0
git push origin v0.3.0
```

Give every release its own version. VS Code keeps running an installed build until the window reloads, and installing another build of the same version replaces its files in place; the panel then asks for a reload. The Marketplace also refuses a version it already has.

The workflow checks that the tag matches `package.json`, creates a GitHub release with the `.vsix` attached, then publishes that same `.vsix` to the VS Code Marketplace. Publishing is a separate job, so if it fails you can re-run just that job once the problem is fixed; the GitHub release is already in place.

Follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Command IDs and setting names (`historySlider.*`) are the public surface: renaming or removing one is a breaking change, which bumps the minor version while the version is `0.x`.

### Marketplace publishing

The publish job signs in with Microsoft Entra ID; there is no personal access token. It needs:

- A GitHub environment named `vscode-marketplace` whose deployment policy allows `main` and `v*` tags, with the **variables** (not secrets) `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`.
- The user-assigned managed identity `andrewbenz-marketplace` (that client ID) with a federated credential for GitHub Actions: organization `Andorbal`, repository `history-slider`, entity type *Environment*, environment `vscode-marketplace`. In the Azure portal it's under **Managed Identities** → `andrewbenz-marketplace` → **Settings** → **Federated credentials**, not App registrations. What the Test publishes with the same identity, so the credential's subject is the only thing specific to this repo. Renaming the repo breaks it.
- That identity added as a member (role Contributor or higher) of the `AndrewBenz` publisher at <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/manage/publishers/AndrewBenz>.

To check all three without publishing anything, run the **Marketplace check** workflow (`.github/workflows/marketplace-check.yml`) from the Actions tab.
